Scheduler Transfer for transactional transfer between accounts

Created by drsantos20 (Daniel Santos)

Technologies used:
- Gradle
- Spring Boot
- Spring MVC 
- Junit and Mock (for tests)
- Java8

The step 3 has been created with controller/rest on spring (users can see scheduled transfers)
 - the port is 8090 (http://localhost:8090/transaction)

For run: gradle build && java -jar build/libs/scheduler-transfer-0.0.1.jar

If you use eclipse, maybe you will need to install gradle plugin (see: https://steffenschaefer.github.io/gwt-gradle-plugin/doc/latest/eclipse)
